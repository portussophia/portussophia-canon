# Contributing to PortusSophia™ Canon

## Canonical Content Only

This repository accepts **canonical content only**. Review `CANON.md` for scope definition.

## Before Submitting

1. **Verify canonical status**: Ensure your content is foundational, immutable, and essential
2. **Check scope**: Confirm content type (postulate, doctrine, mapping, or artifact)
3. **Review existing canon**: Ensure alignment and no conflicts with existing canonical content
4. **Redirect non-canonical content**: 
   - WebKernel → `portussophia/portussophia-webkernel`
   - Governance → `portussophia/portussophia-governance`
   - Narrative → Appropriate narrative repositories
   - Interpretations → Not accepted
   - Implementations → Implementation repositories
