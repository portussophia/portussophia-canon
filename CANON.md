# PortusSophia™ Canon

## Scope

This repository contains **canonical content only**. All content herein is sealed, immutable, and forms the foundational doctrine of PortusSophia™.

## Canonical Content Types

### 1. Postulates
Immutable foundational statements that define the core principles of PortusSophia™. Once sealed, postulates cannot be modified.

### 2. Doctrine
Formal doctrinal statements derived from postulates. Doctrinal content is sealed upon acceptance.

### 3. Mappings
Authoritative mappings between canonical concepts, terms, and structures.

### 4. Hashed Artifacts
Cryptographically sealed artifacts with recorded hashes for integrity verification.

## Non-Canonical Content

The following do **not** belong in this repository:

- **WebKernel implementations** → Redirect to `portussophia/portussophia-webkernel`
- **Governance templates** → Redirect to `portussophia/portussophia-governance`
- **Narrative content** → Redirect to appropriate narrative repositories
- **Interpretations** → Not canonical; interpretations are derivative
- **Metaphysical expansions** → Not within canon scope
- **Implementation details** → Redirect to implementation repositories

## Protection Rules

1. **No alterations** to sealed artifacts, hashes, or doctrine
2. **No drift** from canonical scope
3. **Formal tone** required in all canonical documents
4. **Minimal content** approach; canonical content must be essential
5. **PortusSophia™ trademark** must be preserved exactly with ™ symbol
6. **Explicit approval** required for new canonical content additions

## Submission Requirements

New canonical content submissions must:

1. Clearly identify the canonical content type (postulate, doctrine, mapping, artifact)
2. Provide justification for canonical status
3. Demonstrate alignment with existing canonical content
4. Include cryptographic hash for artifacts
5. Be reviewed and approved by canonical guardians
6. Use formal, minimal language without interpretation

## Integrity Verification

All sealed artifacts must maintain their cryptographic hashes. Any modification to a sealed artifact invalidates the canon.
