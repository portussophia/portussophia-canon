# PortusSophia™ Doctrine

## Overview

Doctrine consists of formal doctrinal statements derived from postulates. Doctrinal content is sealed upon acceptance and becomes immutable.

## Structure

Each doctrine file must contain:

1. Doctrine identifier (D-NNNN)
2. Doctrinal statement
3. Source postulates
4. Seal date
5. Cryptographic hash

## Relationship to Postulates

Doctrine must be derivable from existing postulates. No doctrine may contradict canonical postulates.

## Submission

Doctrine submissions require:
- Clear derivation from postulates
- Formal language
- Canonical guardian approval
- Hash for integrity verification
