# PortusSophia™ Postulates

## Overview

Postulates are immutable foundational statements that define core principles of PortusSophia™. Once sealed, postulates cannot be modified.

## Structure

Each postulate file must contain:

1. Postulate identifier (P-NNNN)
2. Statement text
3. Seal date
4. Cryptographic hash
5. References (if applicable)

## Submission

Postulate submissions require:
- Justification for foundational status
- Demonstration of uniqueness
- Canonical guardian approval
- Community review period

New postulates are rare and must meet the highest standard for canonical inclusion.
