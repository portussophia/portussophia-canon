# PortusSophia™ Canon Repository

This repository contains the **sealed Canon** of PortusSophia™ — the authoritative, immutable doctrinal content of the system.

## Purpose
The Canon defines:
- foundational postulates  
- formal axioms  
- sealed philosophical structures  
- governance-approved doctrinal elements  
- immutable, hashed artifacts  

Once sealed, Canon files are governed by PS-STD-060 and may only be modified through authorized stewardship cycles.

## Contents
- Canonical documents (PS-CAN-*)  
- Postulates (N₁–N₇)  
- Formal definitions  
- Structural axioms  
- Sealing metadata and integrity hashes  
- Canon lineage and witness records  

## What Does NOT Belong Here
- Governance rules (use `portussophia-governance`)  
- WebKernel interpretive explanations  
- Runtime code  
- Narrative or funding vectors  
- Educational scaffolding  

## Notes
The Canon is not public domain.  
It is controlled by PortusSophia™ governance and protected by trademark and structural constraints.
